## infosphere megastructures

<i>I'm excited to share that I'll give an online talk on [building customizable and collaborative AI assistants](https://hcil.umd.edu/bbl-speaker-series/) at [Joel Chan's](http://joelchan.me/) [HCI lab](https://hcil.umd.edu/), as part of their weekly speaker series. I'll touch on a few recent projects, especially [dual](/thoughtware/dual) and [oneironomicon](/thoughtware/oneironomicon), framing them as [tool AI versus agent AI](https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI). It's going to take place next Thursday (Feb. 24th) at 12:30 ET, and you can sign up [here](https://umd.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYsdO2pqTgrHNThvkrExxEIwi-AqVkNqqB_).</i>

Around a year into the pandemic, I read about China's relatively isolationist policy boasting majority support from the general public. Having virtually no qualification whatsoever to make moral judgements on the foreign policy itself, I was merely struck by how unfamiliar and widespread the invoked worldview was. It was as if I came across one of those documentaries on exotic creatures lurking in the ocean. I can't tell whether this odd fish is the cruelest or the kindest one in its habitat, but I can definitely appreciate its strange nature. Oh, and there are an estimated gazillion of them out there? Woah! That op-ed led me to a similar sense of awe, a reminder of how diverse the meme pool is outside our day-to-day environment, should we momentarily suspend judgement. The present article describes a few possible ways of relating to this biodiversity of ideas. Amateur commentary on a controversial topic, so tread carefully.

- team sparse

If we invoke the same ambitions of wildlife preservation and habitat conservation in the realm of memetics, rather than animal or plant life, we might suddenly become reluctant to fully buy into a global infosphere. Throughout history, connecting distant lands by new trade routes led to a sudden uptick in disease, with indigenous animal and plant species being vulnerable to pests carried on board, due to their lack of adaptation. Today, we [thoroughly disinfect our spacecraft](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/solarsystem/mer_clean.html) so as not to bring harms to newly discovered worlds. In a more ordinary setting, hygiene has long been standard practice for helping a variety of plants and animals thrive.

Why then, are we not putting more careful thought in [information hygiene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzGjEkp772s)? If we recognize the value of diversity in ensuring the resilience of populations, why aren't we reflecting more on preserving indigenous populations of ideas when casually connecting half of humanity through a handful of digital plarforms? The talking points of team sparse revolve around digital colonialism and analogies to monocultures versus tropical forests. Herbert Schiller's [Communication and Cultural Domination](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27868829) is a representative stance.

- team dense

The rhetoric at the other end of the spectrum goes something along the lines of... Why encourage closed-off bubbles when we've seen that naive interventionism breeds fragile individuals? Let ideas face one another directly, expose their flaws and shortcomings instead of idealizing their uniqueness and wrapping them in a protective blanket. The most useful, truthful, and insightful takes might very well prevail. Haven't you read [Nassim Taleb](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile)? However, casting survival-of-the-fittest in such an aggressive and competitive light has led to terrible, _horrendous_ pages in the history book of the previous century.

While [good ideas come when ideas have sex](https://nesslabs.com/conor-white-sullivan-interview), there might be value in incubating nascent thoughts before [letting them out into the world](/reflections/thinking-in-public). People who are into digital gardens speak of [growing conceptual seedlings into coherent evergreen ideas](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) (filter by growth stages on link), yet peer pressure hinders the embryonic development of diverging thoughts, even if they'd later cause a paradigm shift. When scaled to entire communities, the entire collective consciousness is often incentivized into the conformity of dogma. In both cases, while priors provide a useful reference for updating beliefs in light of new evidence, social drives might increase this [ideological inertia](/reflections/navigating-ideology) beyond justification, undermining some of the advertised features of a dense infosphere. The influence of user-misaligned algorithms in shaping this landscape for better or worse deserves its own commentary.

However, there's a middle way. In this case, it takes on the name of [holobionts](https://theproudholobionts.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-memesphere-as-holobiont-mousetrap.html): islands of densely-connected ecologies which themselves are sparsely-connected with each other. As a blueprint for the infosphere, it provides a stronger connection between communities than nations speaking different languages in the past, yet a weaker connection than the present superhighways of information with certain creators having audiences larger than a dozen nations. Those communities arguably exist already on social media, but are eclipsed both extremely dense and sparse structures. The [fediverse](https://fediverse.party/) is even closer to this architecture, yet lags behind in terms of userbase.
